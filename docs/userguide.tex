\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{What is BRAKER2?}\label{what-is-braker2}

The rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes requires fully automated
methods for accurate gene structure annotation. With this goal in mind,
we have developed BRAKER1 \cite{braker1}, a combination of GeneMark-ET
\cite{GeneMark-ET} and AUGUSTUS \cite{AUGUSTUS,stanke2006gene}, that
uses genomic and RNA-Seq data to automatically generate full gene
structure annotations in novel genomes.

However, the quality of RNA-Seq data that is available for annotating a
novel genome is variable, and in some cases, RNA-Seq data is not
available, at all.

BRAKER2 is an extension of BRAKER1 which allows for \textbf{fully
automated training} of the gene prediction tools GeneMark-EX
\cite{AlexandreLomsadze11282005,ter2008gene,GeneMark-ET}\footnote{EX
  = ES/ET/EP/ETP, all available for download under the name
  \emph{GeneMark-ES/ET}} and AUGUSTUS from RNA-Seq and/or protein
homology information, and that integrates the extrinsic evidence from
RNA-Seq and protein homology information into the \textbf{prediction}.

In contrast to other available methods that rely on protein homology
information, BRAKER2 reaches high gene prediction accuracy even in the
absence of the annotation of very closely related species and in the
absence of RNA-Seq data.

BRAKER2 can also combine RNA-Seq and protein homology information.

\subsection{Keys to successful gene prediction}\label{keys-to-successful-gene-prediction}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use a high quality genome assembly. If you have a huge number of very
  short scaffolds in your genome assembly, those short scaffolds will
  likely increase runtime dramatically but will not increase prediction
  accuracy.
\item
  Use simple scaffold names in the genome file
  (e.g.~\texttt{\textgreater{}contig1} will work better than
  \texttt{\textgreater{}contig1\textbar{}my\ custom\ species\ name\textbar{}some\ putative\ function\textbar{}\ /more/information/\ \textbar{}\ and\ lots\ of\ special\ characters\ \%\&!*()\{\}}).
  Make the scaffold names in all your fasta files simple before running
  any alignment program.
\item
  In order to predict genes accurately in a novel genome, the genome
  should be masked for repeats. This will avoid the prediction of false
  positive gene structures in repetitive and low complexitiy regions.
  Repeat masking is also essential for mapping RNA-Seq data to a genome.
  In case of GeneMark-EX and AUGUSTUS, softmasking (i.e.~putting repeat
  regions into lower case letters and all other regions into upper case
  letters) leads to better results than hardmasking (i.e.~replacing
  letters in repetitive regions by the letter \texttt{N} for unknown
  nucleotide). If the genome is masked, use the \texttt{â€“softmasking}
  flag of \texttt{braker.pl}.
\item
  Many genomes have gene structures that will be predicted accurately
  with standard parameters of GeneMark-EX and AUGUSTUS within BRAKER2.
  However, some genomes have clade-specific features, i.e.~special
  branch point model in fungi, or non-standard splice-site patterns.
  Please read the options section \ref{options} in order to determine
  whether any of the custom options may improve gene prediction accuracy
  in the genome of your target species.
\item
  Always check gene prediction results before further usage! You can
  e.g.~use a genome browser for visual inspection of gene models in
  context with extrinsic evidence data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview of modes for running BRAKER2}\label{overview-of-modes-for-running-braker2}

BRAKER2 mainly features semi-unsupervised, extrinsic evidence data
(RNA-Seq and/or protein spliced alignment information) supported
training of GeneMark-EX\footnote{EX=ES/ET/EP} and subsequent training of
AUGUSTUS with integration of extrinsic evidence in the final gene
prediction step. However, there are now a number of additional pipelines
included in BRAKER2. In the following, we give an overview of possible
input files and pipelines:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  genome file, only. In this mode, GeneMark-ES is trained on the genome
  sequence, alone. Long genes predicted by GeneMark-ES are selected for
  training AUGUSTUS. Final predictions by AUGUSTUS are \emph{ab initio}.
  This approach will likely yield lower prediction accuracy than all
  other here described pipelines. (see figure \ref{braker-main-a}),

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figs/braker-es.pdf}
  \caption{BRAKER pipeline A: training GeneMark-ES on genome data, only;
  \emph{ab initio} gene prediction with AUGUSTUS.\label{braker-main-a}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  genome and RNA-Seq file from the same species (see figure
  \ref{braker-main-b}); this approach is suitable for RNA-Seq libraries
  with a good coverage of the transcriptome, \textbf{important:} this
  approach requires that each intron is covered by many alignments,
  i.e.~it does not work with assembled transcriptome mappings,

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figs/braker1.pdf}
  \caption{BRAKER pipeline B: training GeneMark-ET supported by RNA-Seq
  spliced alignment information, prediction with AUGUSTUS with that same
  spliced alignment information.\label{braker-main-b}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  genome file and database of proteins that may be of longer
  evolutionary distance to the target species (see figure
  \ref{braker-main-c}); this approach is suitable if no RNA-Seq data is
  available, and if no protein data from a very closely related species
  is available, \textbf{important:} this approach requires a database of
  protein families, i.e.~many representatives of each protein family
  must be present in the database, please contact Alexandre Lomsadze for
  information about the required external GaTech protein mapping
  pipeline,

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figs/braker2_ep.pdf}
  \caption{BRAKER pipeline C: training GeneMark-EP on protein spliced
  alignment information, prediction with AUGUSTUS with that same spliced
  alignment information. Proteins used here can be of longer
  evolutionary distance.\label{braker-main-c}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  genome and RNA-Seq file from the same species, and proteins that may
  be of longer evolutionary distance to the target species (see figure
  \ref{braker-main-d}); \textbf{important:} this approach requires a
  database of protein families, i.e.~many representatives of each
  protein family must be present in the database,

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figs/braker2_ep_rnaseq.pdf}
  \caption{BRAKER pipeline D: training GeneMark-ETP supported by RNA-Seq
  alignment information and protein spliced alignment information
  (proteins can be of longer evolutionary distance), prediction with
  AUGUSTUS using the same alignment information. Introns supported by
  both RNA-Seq and protein alignment information are treated as ``true
  positive introns'', their prediction in gene structures by
  GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS is enforced.\label{braker-main-d}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  genome file and file with proteins of short evolutionary distance (see
  figure \ref{braker2-sidetrack-b}); this approach is suitable if
  RNA-Seq data is not available and if the reference species is very
  closely related,

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figs/braker2_gth.pdf}
  \caption{Additional pipeline B: training AUGUSTUS on the basis of
  spliced alignment information from proteins of a very closely related
  species against the target genome.\label{braker2-sidetrack-b}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  genome and RNA-Seq file and proteins of short evolutionary distance
  (see figures \ref{braker2-sidetrack-a} and \ref{braker2-sidetrack-c}).
  In both cases, GeneMark-ET is trained supported by RNA-Seq data, and
  the resulting gene predictions are used for training AUGUSTUS. In
  approach A), protein alignment information is used in the gene
  prediction step with AUGUSTUS, only. In approach C), protein spliced
  alignment data is used to complement the training set for AUGUSTUS.
  The latter approach is in particular suitable if RNA-Seq data does not
  produce a sufficiently high number of training gene structures for
  AUGUSTUS, and if a very closely related and already annotated species
  is available.

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figs/braker2.pdf}
  \caption{Additional pipeline A: training GeneMark-ET supported by
  RNA-Seq spliced alignment information, prediction with AUGUSTUS with
  spliced alignment information from RNA-Seq data and with gene features
  determined by alignments from proteins of a very closely related
  species against the target genome.\label{braker2-sidetrack-a}}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figs/braker2_train_from_both.pdf}
  \caption{Additional pipeline C: training GeneMark-ET on the basis of
  RNA-Seq spliced alignment information, training AUGUSTUS on a set of
  training gene structures compiled from RNA-Seq supported gene
  structures predicted by GeneMark-ET and spliced alignment of proteins
  of a very closely related species.\label{braker2-sidetrack-c}}
  \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{BRAKER2}\label{braker2}

\subsubsection{Perl pipeline dependencies}\label{perl-pipeline-dependencies}

Running BRAKER2 requires a Linux-system with \texttt{bash} and Perl.
Furthermore, BRAKER2 requires the following CPAN-Perl modules to be
installed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{File::Spec::Functions}
\item
  \texttt{Hash::Merge}
\item
  \texttt{List::Util}
\item
  \texttt{Logger::Simple}
\item
  \texttt{Module::Load::Conditional}
\item
  \texttt{Parallel::ForkManager}
\item
  \texttt{POSIX}
\item
  \texttt{Scalar::Util::Numeric}
\item
  \texttt{YAML}
\end{itemize}

On Ubuntu, for example, install the modules with CPANminus\footnote{install
  with \texttt{sudo apt-get install cpanminus}}:
\texttt{sudo cpanm Module::Name}, e.g.
\texttt{sudo cpanm Hash::Merge}.

BRAKER2 also uses a Perl module \texttt{helpMod.pm} that is not
available on CPAN. This module is part of the BRAKER2 release and does
not require separate installation.

\subsubsection{BRAKER2 components}\label{Executability}

BRAKER2 is a collection of Perl scripts and a Perl module. The main
script that will be called in order to run BRAKER2 is
\texttt{braker.pl}. Additional Perl components are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{align2hints.pl}
\item
  \texttt{filterGenemark.pl}
\item
  \texttt{filterIntronsFindStrand.pl}
\item
  \texttt{startAlign.pl}
\item
  \texttt{helpMod.pm}
\item
  \texttt{findGenesInIntrons.pl}
\item
  \texttt{downsample\_traingenes.pl}
\end{itemize}

All Perl scripts (files ending with \texttt{*.pl}) that are part of
BRAKER2 must be executable in order to run BRAKER2. This should already
be the case if you download BRAKER2 from our website. Executability may
be overwritten if you e.g.~transfer BRAKER2 on a USB-stick to anothre
computer. In order to check whether required files are executable, run
the following command in the directory that contains BRAKER2 Perl
scripts:

\begin{verbatim}
ls -l *.pl
\end{verbatim}

The output should be similar to this:

\begin{verbatim}
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina  18191 Mai  7 10:25 align2hints.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina 408782 Aug 17 18:24 braker.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina   5024 Mai  7 10:25 downsample_traingenes.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina  30453 Mai  7 10:25 filterGenemark.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina   5754 Mai  7 10:25 filterIntronsFindStrand.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina   7765 Mai  7 10:25 findGenesInIntrons.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 katharina katharina  41674 Mai  7 10:25 startAlign.pl
\end{verbatim}

It is important that the \texttt{x} in \texttt{-rwxr-xr-x} is present
for each script. If that is not the case, run

\begin{verbatim}
chmod a+x *.pl
\end{verbatim}

in order to change file attributes.

You may find it helpful to add the directory in which BRAKER2 perl
scripts reside to your \texttt{\$PATH} environment variable. For a
single bash session, enter:

\begin{verbatim}
PATH=/your_path_to_braker/:$PATH
export PATH
    
\end{verbatim}

To make this \texttt{\$PATH} modification available to all bash
sessions, add the above lines to a startup script
(e.g.\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}).

\subsection{Bioinformatics software dependencies}\label{bioinformatics-software-dependencies}

BRAKER2 calls upon various bioinformatics software tools that are not
part of BRAKER2. Some tools are obligatory, i.e.~BRAKER2 will not run at
all if these tools are not present on your system. Other tools are
optional. Please install all tools that are required for running BRAKER2
in the mode of your choice.

\subsubsection{Mandatory tools}\label{mandatory-tools}

\paragraph{GeneMark-EX}\label{genemark-ex}

Download GeneMark-EX\footnote{EX=ES/ET/EP/ETP, available as
  \emph{GeneMark-ES/ET}} from
\url{http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi}. Unpack and
install GeneMark-EX as described in GeneMark-EX's \texttt{README} file.

If already contained in your \texttt{\$PATH} variable, BRAKER2 will
guess the location of \texttt{gmes\_petap.pl}, automatically. Otherwise,
BRAKER2 can find GeneMark-EX executables either by locating them in an
environment variable \texttt{GENEMARK\_PATH}, or by taking a command
line argument\\
(\texttt{â€“GENEMARK\_PATH=/your\_path\_to\_GeneMark-EX/gmes\_petap/}).

In order to set the environment variable for your current Bash session,
type:

\begin{verbatim}
export GENEMARK_PATH=/your_path_to_GeneMark-ET/gmes_petap/
\end{verbatim}

Add the above lines to a startup script
(e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}) in order to make it
available to all bash sessions.\footnote{GeneMark-EX is not a mandatory
  tool if AUGUSTUS is to be trained from GenomeThreader aligments with
  the option \texttt{â€“trainFromGth}.}

\paragraph{AUGUSTUS}\label{augustus}

Download AUGUSTUS from \url{https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus}.
Unpack AUGUSTUS and install AUGUSTUS according to AUGUSTUS
\texttt{README.TXT}.

You should compile AUGUSTUS on your own system in order to avoid
problems with versions of libraries used by AUGUSTUS. Compilation
instructions are provided in the AUGUSTUS \texttt{README.TXT} file
(\texttt{Augustus/README.txt}).

AUGUSTUS consists of \texttt{augustus}, the gene prediction tool,
additional C++ tools located in\\
\texttt{augustus/auxprogs} and Perl scripts located in
\texttt{augustus/scripts}. Perl scripts must be executable (see
instructions in section \ref{Executability}.

The C++ tool \texttt{bam2hints} is an essential component of BRAKER2.
Sources are located in\\
\texttt{Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints}. Make sure that you compile
\texttt{bam2hints} on your system (it should be automatically compiled
when AUGUSTUS is compiled, but in case of problems with
\texttt{bam2hints}, please read troubleshooting instructions in
\texttt{Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints/README}).

If you would like to train UTR parameters and integrate RNA-Seq coverage
information into gene prediction with BRAKER2 (which is possible only if
an RNA-Seq bam-file is provided as extrinsic evidence),
\texttt{utrrnaseq} and \texttt{bam2wig} in the \texttt{auxprogs}
directory are also required. If compilation with the default
\texttt{Makefile} fails, please read troubleshooting instructions in
\texttt{Augustus/auxprogs/bam2wig/README.txt} and
\texttt{Augustus/auxprogs/utrrnaseq/README}, respectively.

Since BRAKER2 is a pipeline that trains AUGUSTUS, i.e.~writes species
specific parameter files, BRAKER2 needs writing access to the
configuration directory of AUGUSTUS that contains such files
(\texttt{Augustus/config/}). If you install AUGUSTUS globally on your
system, the \texttt{config} folder will typically not be writable by all
users. Either make the directory where \texttt{config} resides
recursively writable to users of AUGUSTUS, or copy the \texttt{config/}
folder (recursively) to a location where users have writing permission.

AUGUSTUS will locate the \texttt{config} folder by looking for an
environment variable \texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH}. If the
\texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH} environment variable is not set, then
BRAKER2 will look in the path \texttt{../config} relative to the
directory in which it finds an AUGUSTUS executable. Alternatively, you
can supply the variable as a command line argument to BRAKER2\\
(\texttt{â€“AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH=/your\_path\_to\_AUGUSTUS/augustus/config/}).
We recommend that you export the variable e.g.~for your current bash
session:

\begin{verbatim}
export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your_path_to_AUGUSTUS/augustus/config/
    
\end{verbatim}

In order to make the variable available to all Bash sessions, add the
above line to a startup script,
e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}.

\subparagraph{Important:}\label{important}

BRAKER2 expects the entire \texttt{config} directory of AUGUSTUS at
\texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH}, i.e.~the subfolders \texttt{species}
with its contents (at least \texttt{generic}) and \texttt{extrinsic}!
Providing an writable but empty folder at
\texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH} will not work for BRAKER. If you need
to separate augustus binary and \texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH}, we
recommend that you recursively copy the un-writable config contents to a
writable location.

You have a system-wide installation of AUGUSTUS at
\texttt{/usr/bin/augustus}, an unwritable copy of \texttt{config} sits
at \texttt{/usr/bin/augustus\_config/}. The folder \texttt{/home/yours/}
is writable to you. Copy with the following command (and additionally
set the then required variables):\\
cp -r \textbackslash{}texttt\{/usr/bin/augustus\_config/ /home/yours/
export AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH=/home/yours/augustus\_config export
AUGUSTUS\_BIN\_PATH=/usr/bin export
AUGUSTUS\_SCRIPTS\_PATH=/usr/bin/augustus\_scripts

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{Modification of
\texttt{\$PATH}.}{Modification of \$PATH.}}\label{modification-of-path.}

Adding adding directories of AUGUSTUS binaries and scripts to your
\texttt{\$PATH} variable enables your system to locate these tools,
automatically. It is not a requirement for running BRAKER2 to do this,
because BRAKER2 will try to guess them from the location of another
environment variable (\texttt{\$AUGUSTUS\_CONFIG\_PATH}), or both
directories can be supplied as command line arguments to
\texttt{braker.pl}, but we recommend to add them to your \texttt{\$PATH}
variable. For your current bash session, type:

\begin{verbatim}
PATH=:/your_path_to_augustus/bin/:/your_path_to_augustus/scripts/:$PATH
export PATH
    
\end{verbatim}

For all your BASH sessions, add the above lines to a startup script
(e.g.\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}).

\paragraph{Bamtools}\label{bamtools}

Download BAMTOOLS
(e.g.~\texttt{git\ clone\ https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools.git}).
Install BAMTOOLS by typing the following in your shell:\\
cd your-bamtools-directory mkdir build cd build cmake .. make

If already in your \texttt{\$PATH} variable, BRAKER2 will find bamtools,
automatically. Otherwise, BRAKER2 can locate the bamtools binary either
by using an environment variable \texttt{\$BAMTOOLS\_PATH}, or by taking
a command line argument
(\texttt{â€“BAMTOOLS\_PATH=/your\_path\_to\_bamtools/bin/}\footnote{The
  binary may e.g.~reside in bamtools/build/src/toolkit}). In order to
set the environment variable e.g.~for your current bash session, type:

\begin{verbatim}
export BAMTOOLS_PATH=/your_path_to_bamtools/bin/ 
    
\end{verbatim}

Add the above line to a startup script
(e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}) in order to set the
environment variable for all bash sessions.

\paragraph{NCBI BLAST+}\label{ncbi-blast}

On Ubuntu, install with \texttt{sudo\ apt-get\ install\ ncbi-blast+}.

If already in your \texttt{\$PATH} variable, BRAKER2 will find blastp,
automatically. Otherwise, BRAKER2 can locate the blastp binary either by
using an environment variable \texttt{\$BLAST\_PATH}, or by taking a
command line argument (\texttt{â€“BLAST\_PATH=/your\_path\_to\_blast/}).
In order to set the environment variable e.g.~for your current bash
session, type:

\begin{verbatim}
export BLAST_PATH=/your_path_to_blast/ 
    
\end{verbatim}

Add the above line to a startup script
(e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}) in order to set the
environment variable for all bash sessions.

\subsubsection{Optional tools}\label{optional-tools}

\paragraph{Samtools}\label{samtools}

Samtools is not required for running BRAKER2 if all your files are
formatted, correctly (i.e.~all sequences should have short and unique
fasta names). If you are not sure whether all your files are fomatted
correctly, it might be helpful to have Samtools installed because
BRAKER2 can automatically fix certain format issues by using Samtools.

As a prerequisite for Samtools, download and install \texttt{htslib}
(e.g.~ \texttt{git\ clone\ https://github.com/samtools/htslib.git},
follow the \texttt{htslib} documentation for installation).

Download and install Samtools (e.g.
\texttt{git\ clone\ git://github.com/samtools/samtools.git}),
subsequently follow Samtools documentation for installation).

If already in your \texttt{\$PATH} variable, BRAKER2 will find samtools,
automatically. Otherwise, BRAKER2 can find Samtools either by taking a
command line argument\\
(\texttt{â€“SAMTOOLS\_PATH=/your\_path\_to\_samtools/}), or by using an
environment variable \texttt{\$SAMTOOLS\_PATH}. For exporting the
variable, e.g.~for your current bash session, type:

\begin{verbatim}
export SAMTOOLS_PATH=/your_path_to_samtools/
    
\end{verbatim}

Add the above line to a startup script
(e.g.~\texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc}) in order to set the
environment variable for all bash sessions.

\paragraph{Python3 \& Biopython}\label{python3-biopython}

If Python3 and Biopython are installed, BRAKER2 can generate FASTA-files
with coding sequences and protein sequences predicted by AUGUSTUS. This
is an optional step, it can be disabled with the command-line flag
\texttt{-\/-skipGetAnnoFromFasta}; Python3 and Biopython are not
required if this flag is set.

On Ubuntu, Python3 is installed by default. Install the Python3 package
manager with:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
\end{verbatim}

Subsequently, install Biopython with:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo pip3 install biopython
\end{verbatim}

On Ubuntu, python3 will be in your \$PATH variable, by default, and
BRAKER2 will automatically locate it. However, you have the option to
specify the \texttt{python3} binary location in two other ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Export an environment variable \texttt{\$PYTHON3\_PATH}, e.g.~in your
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}sim/.bashrc} file:

\begin{verbatim}
export PYTHON3_PATH=/path/to/python3/
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Specify the command line option
  \texttt{-\/-PYTHON3\_PATH=/path/to/python3/} to \texttt{braker.pl}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{GenomeThreader}\label{genomethreader}

This tool is required, only, if you would like to run protein to genome
alignments with BRAKER2 using GenomeThreader. This is a suitable
approach if an annotated species of short evolutionary distance to your
target genome is available. Download GenomeThreader from
\url{http://genomethreader.org/}. Unpack and install according to
\texttt{gth/README}.

BRAKER2 will try to locate the GenomeThreader executable by using an
environment variable\\
\texttt{\$ALIGNMENT\_TOOL\_PATH}. Alternatively, this can be supplied as
command line argument\\
(\texttt{â€“ALIGNMENT\_TOOL\_PATH=/your/path/to/gth}).

\paragraph{Spaln}\label{spaln}

This tool is required, only, if you would like to run protein to genome
alignments with BRAKER2 using Spaln. This is a suitable approach if an
annotated species of short evolutionary distance to your target genome
is available. (We recommend the usage of GenomeThreader instad of
Spaln.) Download Spaln from
\url{http://www.genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aln_user}. Unpack and
install according to \texttt{spaln/doc/SpalnReadMe22.pdf}.

BRAKER2 will try to locate the Spaln executable by using an environment
variable \texttt{\$ALIGNMENT\_TOOL\_PATH}. Alternatively, this can be
supplied as command line argument\\
(\texttt{â€“ALIGNMENT\_TOOL\_PATH=/your/path/to/spaln}).

\paragraph{Exonerate}\label{exonerate}

This tool is required, only, if you would like to run protein to genome
alignments with BRAKER2 using Exonerate. This is a suitable approach if
an annotated species of short evolutionary distance to your target
genome is available. (We recommend the usage of GenomeThreader instad of
Exonerate because Exonerate is comparably slower and has lower
specificity than GenomeThreader.) Download Exonerate from
\url{https://github.com/nathanweeks/exonerate}. Unpack and install
according to \texttt{exonerate/README}. (On Ubuntu, download and install
by typing \texttt{sudo\ apt-get\ install\ exonerate}.)

command line argument\\
(\texttt{â€“ALIGNMENT\_TOOL\_PATH=/your/path/to/exonerate}).

\section{Running BRAKER2}\label{running-braker2}

\subsection{Different BRAKER2 pipeline modes}\label{different-braker2-pipeline-modes}

In the following, we describe ``typical'' BRAKER2 calls for different
input data types. In general, we recommend that you run BRAKER2 on
genomic sequences that have been softmasked for Repeats. If your genome
has been softmasked, include the \texttt{â€“softmasking} flag in your
BRAKER2 call!

\subsubsection{BRAKER2 with RNA-Seq data (only)}\label{braker1}

.

This approach is suitable for genomes of species for which RNA-Seq
libraries with a good coverage of the transcriptome are available. The
pipeline is illustrated in figure \ref{braker-main-b}.

BRAKER2 can either extract RNA-Seq spliced alignment information from
\texttt{bam} files, or it can use such extracted information, directly.

In order to run BRAKER2 with RNA-Seq data supplied as \texttt{bam}
file(s) (in case of multiple files, separate them by comma), run:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\
   --bam=file1.bam,file2.bam
\end{verbatim}

In order to run BRAKER2 with RNA-Seq spliced alignment information that
has already been extracted, run:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --hints=hints1.gff,hints2.gff
\end{verbatim}

The format of such a hints file must be as follows (tabulator separated
file):

\begin{verbatim}
chrName b2h intron  6591    8003    1   +   .   pri=4;src=E
chrName b2h intron  6136    9084    11  +   .   mult=11;pri=4;src=E
...
\end{verbatim}

The source \texttt{b2h} in the second column and the source tag
\texttt{src=E} in the last column are essential for BRAKER2 to determine
whether a hint has been generated from RNA-Seq data.

\paragraph{Training and prediction of UTRs, integration of coverage
information}\label{training-and-prediction-of-utrs-integration-of-coverage-information}

If RNA-Seq (and only RNA-Seq) data is provided to BRAKER2 as a bam-file,
and if the genome is softmasked for repeats, BRAKER2 can automatically
train UTR parameters for AUGUSTUS. After successful training of UTR
parameters, BRAKER2 will automatically predict genes including coverage
information form RNA-Seq data. Example call:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --bam=file.bam --softmasking --UTR=on
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Stranded RNA-Seq
alignments}\label{stranded-rna-seq-alignments}

For running BRAKER2 without UTR paramters, it is not very important
whether RNA-Seq data was generated by a \emph{stranded} protocol
(because spliced alignments are 'artificially stranded' by checking the
splice site pattern). However, for UTR training and prediction, stranded
libraries may provide information that is valuable for BRAKER2.

After alignment of the stranded RNA-Seq libraries, separate the
resulting bam file entries into two files: one for plus strand mappings,
one for minus strand mappings. Call BRAKER2 as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --softmasking --bam=plus.bam,minus.bam --stranded=+,- \
    --UTR=on
\end{verbatim}

You may additionally include bam files from unstranded libraries. Those
files will not used for generating UTR training examples, but they will
be included in the final gene prediction step as unstranded coverage
information, example call:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --softmasking --bam=plus.bam,minus.bam,unstranded.bam \
   --stranded=+,-,. --UTR=on
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{BRAKER2 with proteins of longer evolutionary distance}\label{braker2-with-proteins-of-longer-evolutionary-distance}

This approach is suitable for genomes of species for which no RNA-Seq
libraries are available and for which no closely related and well
annotated genome is available. A database of proteins with longer
evolutionary distance to the target species may be used in this case.
The pipeline is illustrated in figure \ref{gatech}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./figs/gatech-prot-pipeline.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Protein mapping pipeline for proteins of longer evolutionary distance.\label{gatech}}
\end{figure}

Running BRAKER2 with proteins of longer evolutionary distance requires
the preparation of ``protein hints'' before running BRAKER2, itself.
Preparing protein hints is in this case not part of BRAKER2 because in
contrast to BRAKER2, which can run on a work station with one or
multiple cores, the GeneMark-EP specific protein mapping pipeline
requires a cluster for execution. Please contact Alexandre Lomsadze for
more information about the protein mapping pipeline.

For running BRAKER2 in this mode, type:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
\end{verbatim}

The format of such a hints file must be as follows (tabulator separated
file):

\begin{verbatim}
chrName ProSplign   intron  6591    8003    5   +   .   mult=5;pri=4;src=P
chrName ProSplign   intron  6136    9084    11  +   .   mult=11;pri=4;src=P
...
\end{verbatim}

The source \texttt{ProSplign} in the second column and the source tag
\texttt{src=P} in the last column are essential for BRAKER2 to determine
whether a hint has been generated from remote homology protein data.

\subsubsection{BRAKER2 with proteins of shorter evolutionary distance}\label{prot-in}

This approach is suitable if RNA-Seq data for the species of the target
genome is not available and if a well annotated and very closely related
reference species is available. The pipeline is illustrated in figure
\ref{braker2-sidetrack-b}

For running BRAKER2 in this mode, type:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --prot_seq=proteins.fa --prg=gth \
   --ALIGNMENT_TOOL_PATH=/path/to/gth/binary \
   --trainFromGth
\end{verbatim}

It is possible to generate protein alignments externally, prior running
BRAKER2, itself. The compatible command for running GenomeThreader prior
running BRAKER2, is:

\begin{verbatim}
gth -genomic genome.fa  -protein protein.fa -gff3out \
   -skipalignmentout -o gth.aln
\end{verbatim}

In order to use such externally created alignment files, run:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --prot_aln=proteins.aln --prg=gth --trainFromGth
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to run BRAKER2 in this mode using an already
prepared hints file. In this case, run:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --hints=hints.gff --prg=gth --trainFromGth
\end{verbatim}

Format of the hints file should look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
chrName   gth2h   CDSpart 105984  106633  .     -    .    src=P;grp=FBpp0285205;pri=4
chrName   gth2h   start   106646  106648  .     -    .    src=P;grp=FBpp0285205;pri=4
\end{verbatim}

Supported features are intron, CDSpart, start, stop.

\subsubsection{BRAKER2 with RNA-Seq and protein data}\label{braker2-with-rna-seq-and-protein-data}

BRAKER2 with RNA-Seq and protein data is currently still under
development. BRAKER2 currently does not train GeneMark-EX from protein
and RNA-Seq data, yet. However, if RNA-Seq data of the target species
and protein data of a very closely related reference species are
available, BRAKER2 already supports the following to modes.

\paragraph{Adding protein data of short evolutionary distance to gene
prediction
step}\label{adding-protein-data-of-short-evolutionary-distance-to-gene-prediction-step}

This pipeline is illustrated in figure \ref{braker2-sidetrack-a}.

In general, add the options

\begin{verbatim}
   --prot_seq=proteins.fa --prg=(gth|exonerate|spaln)
\end{verbatim}

to the BRAKER2 call that is described in section \ref{braker1}. Select
one protein alignment tool from GenomeThreader (\texttt{gth},
recommended), Spaln (\texttt{spaln}) or Exonerate (\texttt{exonerate}).
Of course, you may also specify the protein information as protein
alignment files or hints files as described in section \ref{prot-in}).
This may result in a call similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --bam=file1.bam,file2.bam --prot_seq=proteins.fa \
   --prg=(gth|exonerate|spaln)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Extending training gene set with proteins of short
evolutionary
distance}\label{extending-training-gene-set-with-proteins-of-short-evolutionary-distance}

If the number of training gene structures identified by RNA-Seq data,
only, seems to be too small, you may add training gene structures
generated by protein alignments with GenomeThreader to the training gene
set. This pipeline is illustrated in \ref{braker2-sidetrack-c}.

In general, add the options

\begin{verbatim}
   --prot_seq=proteins.fa --prg=gth --gth2traingenes
\end{verbatim}

to the BRAKER2 call that is described in section \ref{braker1}. This may
result in a call similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \
   --bam=file1.bam,file2.bam --prot_seq=proteins.fa \
   --prg=gth --gth2traingenes
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Description of selected BRAKER2 command line options}\label{options}

Please run \texttt{braker.pl\ â€“help} to obtain a full list of options.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“ab\_initio}}{--ab\_initio}}\label{ab_initio}

Compute AUGUSTUS \emph{ab initio} predictions in addition to AUGUSTUS
predictions with hints (additional output files:
\texttt{augustus.ab\_initio.*}. This may be useful for estimating the
quality of training gene parameters when inspecting predictions in a
Browser.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“augustus\_args=â€“some\_arg=bla}}{--augustus\_args=--some\_arg=bla}}\label{augustus_argssome_argbla}

One or several command line arguments to be passed to AUGUSTUS, if
several arguments are given, separated by whitespace,
i.e.~\texttt{â€“first\_arg=sth\ â€“second\_arg=sth}. This may be be useful
if you know that gene prediction in your particular species benefits
from a particular AUGUSTUS argument during the prediction step.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“cores=INT}}{--cores=INT}}\label{coresint}

Specifies the maximum number of cores that can be used during
computation. BRAKER2 has to run some steps on a single core, others can
take advantage of multiple cores. The optimal core number of all steps
is 8. If you use more than 8 cores, this will not speed up all
parallelized steps, in particular, the time consuming
\texttt{optimize\_augustus.pl} will not use more than 8 cores. However,
if you don't mind some cores being idle, using more than 8 cores will
speed up other steps.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“fungus}}{--fungus}}\label{fungus}

GeneMark-EX option: run algorithm with branch point model. Use this
option if you genome is a fungus.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“softmasking}}{--softmasking}}\label{softmasking}

Softmasking option for soft masked genome files. (Disabled by default.)

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“useexisting}}{--useexisting}}\label{useexisting}

Use the present config and parameter files if they exist for 'species'.
This step will skip training AUGUSTUS and instead use pre-trained
parameters.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“crf}}{--crf}}\label{crf}

Execute CRF training for AUGUSTUS; resulting parameters are only kept
for final predictions if they show higher accuracy than HMM parameters.
This increases runtime!

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“lambda=int}}{--lambda=int}}\label{lambdaint}

Change the parameter \(\lambda\) of the Poisson distribution that is
used for downsampling training genes according to their number of
introns (only genes with up to 5 introns are downsampled). The default
value is \(\lambda=2\). You might want to set it to 0 for organisms that
mainly have single-exon genes. (Generally, single-exon genes contribute
less value to increasing AUGUSTUS parameters compared to genes with many
exons.)

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“UTR=on}}{--UTR=on}}\label{utron}

Generate UTR training examples for AUGUSTUS from RNA-Seq coverage
information, train AUGUSTUS UTR parameters and predict genes with
AUGUSTUS and UTRs, including coverage information for RNA-Seq as
evidence. This flag only works if --softmasking is also enabled, and if
the only extrinsic evidence provided are bam files.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{â€“stranded=+,-,.,...}}{--stranded=+,-,.,...}}\label{stranded-....}

If \texttt{â€“UTR=on} is enabled, strand-separated bam-files can be
provided with \texttt{â€“bam=plus.bam,minus.bam}. In that case,
\texttt{â€“stranded=...} should hold the strands of the bam files
(\texttt{+} for plus strand, \texttt{-} for minus strand, \texttt{.} for
unstranded). Note that unstranded data will be used in the gene
prediction step, only, if the parameter \texttt{â€“stranded=...} is set.

\section{Output of BRAKER2}\label{output-of-braker2}

BRAKER2 produces several important output files in the working
directory.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{augustus.hints.gtf}: Genes predicted by AUGUSTUS with intron hints from given extrinsic
  evidence. This file will be missing if BRAKER was run with the option
  \texttt{-\/-esmode}.
\item
  \texttt{augustus.hints\_utr.gtf}: Genes predicted by AUGUSTUS with UTR parameters and coverage
  information from RNA-Seq data in GTF-format. The file will only be
  present if BRAKER was run with the option \texttt{-\/-UTR=on} and a
  RNA-Seq BAM-file.
\item
  \texttt{augustus.ab\_initio.gtf}: Genes predicted by AUGUSTUS in \emph{ab initio} mode in GTF-format.
  The file will always be present if AUGUSTUS has been run with the
  option \texttt{-\/-esmode}. Otherwise, it will only be present if
  BRAKER was run with the option \texttt{-\/-AUGUSTUS\_ab\_initio}.
\item
  \texttt{augustus.ab\_initio\_utr.gtf}: Genes predicted by AUGUSTUS with UTR parameters in \emph{ab initio}
  mode in GTF-format. This file will only be present if BRAKER was
  executed with the options \texttt{-\/-UTR=on} and a RNA-Seq BAM-file,
  and with the option \texttt{-\/-AUGUSTUS\_ab\_initio}.
\item
  \texttt{GeneMark-E*/genemark.gtf}: Genes predicted by GeneMark-ES/ET in GTF-format. This file will be
  missing if BRAKER was executed with proteins of close homology and the
  option \texttt{-\/-trainFromGth}.
\item
  \texttt{hintsfile.gff}: The extrinsic evidence data extracted from RNAseq.bam and/or protein
  data. The introns are used for training GeneMark-ES/ET, all features
  are used for predicting genes with AUGUSTUS. The file is in
  GFF-format.
\end{itemize}

AUGUSTUS output files may be present with the following name endings and
formats:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  GTF-format is always produced.
\item
  GFF3-format is produced if the flat \texttt{-\/-gff3} was specified to
  BRAKER2.
\item
  Coding sequences in FASTA-format are produced if the flag
  \texttt{-\/-skipGetAnnoFromFasta} was not set.
\item
  Protein sequence files in FASTA-format are produced if the flag
  \texttt{-\/-skipGetAnnoFromFasta} was not set.
\end{itemize}

For details about gtf format, see
\url{http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/}. A GTF-format file
contains one line per predicted exon. Example:

\begin{verbatim}
HS04636 AUGUSTUS initial   966 1017 . + 0 transcript_id "g1.1"; gene_id "g1";
HS04636 AUGUSTUS internal 1818 1934 . + 2 transcript_id "g1.1"; gene_id "g1";
\end{verbatim}

The columns (fields) contain:

\begin{verbatim}
seqname source feature start end score strand frame transcript ID and gene ID
\end{verbatim}

\section{Example data}\label{example-data}

An incomplete example data set is contained in the directory
\texttt{BRAKER/example}. In order to complete the data set, please
download the RNA-Seq alignment file (134 MB) with \texttt{wget}:

\begin{verbatim}
cd BRAKER/example
wget http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/braker/RNAseq.bam
\end{verbatim}

The example data set was not compiled in order to achieve optimal
prediction accuracy, but in order to test pipeline components.

\subsection{Data description}\label{data-description}

Data corresponds to \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} chromosome 2R from
flybase release R5, first 12000000 nucleotides.

RNA-Seq alignments were obtained by mapping Illumina paired-end librariy
SRR023505 to the genome file using STAR with standard parameters (single
pass mapping).

Protein sequences from Drosophila ananassae release R1.05 were aligned
to the genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster chromosome R2 using
GenomeThreader with parameters
\texttt{-gff3out\ -skipalignmentout\ -paralogs\ -prseedlength\ 20\ -prhdist\ 2\ -gcmincoverage\ 80\ -prminmatchlen\ 20}.
Protein sequence records of mapped proteins were stored in proteins.fa.

For generating protein hints from proteins of longer evolutionary
distance, proteins from the eggNog database insect proportion were
aligned to \texttt{Drosophila\ melanogaster} genome using the GaTech
protein mapping pipline (excluding \emph{Drosophila} species except for
\emph{D.~grimshawi}, \emph{D.~virilis}, \emph{D.~willistoni},
\emph{D.~pseudoobscura}, \emph{D.~ananassae}).

List of files:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{genome.fa} - genome file in fasta format
\item
  \texttt{RNAseq.bam} - RNA-Seq alignment file in bam format (this file
  is not in github, it must be downloaded separately from
  \url{http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/braker/RNAseq.bam})
\item
  \texttt{RNAseq.hints} - RNA-Seq hints (can be used instead of
  RNAseq.bam as RNA-Seq input to BRAKER2)
\item
  \texttt{prot.fa} - protein sequences of close homology in fasta format
\item
  \texttt{ep.hints} - protein hints of remote homology in gff format
\end{itemize}

Testing BRAKER2 is time consuming because a full test requires the
assembly of sufficient training data and subsequent training of gene
predictors. Consider running BRAKER2 threaded (e.g.~\texttt{â€“cores=8})
for testing. You can also select the \texttt{â€“skipOptimize} option for
all tests that include training of AUGUSTUS in order to speed up
testing.

The below given commands assume that you configured all paths to tools
by exporting bash variables.

The example data set also contains scripts \texttt{tests/test*.sh} that
will execute below listed commands for testing BRAKER2 with the example
data set. You find example results of AUGUSTUS and GeneMark-EX in the
folder \texttt{results/test*}. Be aware that BRAKER2 contains several
parts where random variables are used, i.e.~results that you obtain when
running the tests must not be exactly identical.

We give runtime estimations derived from computing on a single core
\emph{Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz}.

  \texttt{braker/yourSpecies/genbank.good.gb} - try a ``grep -c LOCUS
  genbank.good.gb'' to determine the number of training genes for
  training AUGUSTUS, should not be low
\item
  \texttt{braker/yourSpecies/errors/firstetraining.stderr} - contains
  errors from first iteration of training AUGUSTUS
\item
  \texttt{braker/yourSpecies/errors/secondetraining.stderr} - contains
  errors from second iteration of training AUGUSTUS
\item
  \texttt{braker/yourSpecies/errors/optimize\_augustus.stderr} -
  contains errors optimize\_augustus.pl (additional training set for
  AUGUSTUS)
\item
  \texttt{braker/yourSpecies/errors/augustus*.stderr} - contain AUGUSTUS
  execution errors
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Common problems}\label{commonproblems}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{BRAKER complains that the RNA-Seq file does not correspond to
  the provided genome file, but I am sure the files correspond to each
  other!}\\
  Please check the headers of the genome FASTA file. If the headers are
  long and contain whitespaces, some RNA-Seq alignment tools will
  truncate sequence names in the BAM file. This leads to an error with
  BRAKER. Solution: shorten/simplify FASTA headers in the genome file
  before running the RNA-Seq alignment and BRAKER.
\item
  \emph{There are duplicate Loci in the \texttt{train.gb} file (after
  using GenomeThreader)!}\\
  This issue arises if outdated versions of AUGUSTUS and BRAKER are
  used. Solution: Please update AUGUSTUS and BRAKER from github
  (\url{https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus},
  \url{https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER}).

\section{Citing BRAKER2 and software called by BRAKER2}\label{citing-braker2-and-software-called-by-braker2}

Since BRAKER2 is a pipeline that calls several Bioinformatics tools,
publication of results obtained by BRAKER2 requires that not only
BRAKER2 is cited, but also the tools that are called by BRAKER2:

\begin{itemize}
