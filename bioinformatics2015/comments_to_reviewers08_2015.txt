Dear Allison and dear reviewers,

we hereby submit a revised version of our manuscript "BRAKER1: Unsupervised RNA-Seq-Based Genome Annotation with GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS" for your consideration.

Here are our point-by-point answers to the reviewers's concerns about the originally submitted manuscript:

Reviewer: 1

"Although the manuscript is brief, I found it very surprising that not a single table or figure was included in the main article to indicate the accuracy of BRAKER1 in comparison to alternative methods. All specifics are included in the supplementary materials, even though the supp. materials indicate that Table 1 was to appear in the main manuscript."

We absolutely agree with you. We have now included Table 1 in the main manuscript. This results in a slight exceedance of the usual page limit for Bioinformatics Application Notes. However, we kindly ask the editors to accept this. We are fully willing to pay the additional page charges.

"Another aspect of the results that I found to be bizarre was that the results separately reported for Augustus (supp. table 1.2) are identical to those reported for Braker1 (supp. table 1.1). It would seem, Braker1 represents a rather straightforward way of running Augustus."

We modified the caption of (now table 1 of the main manuscript, previously Supplementary Table 1.1): "Accuracy results of the final gene prediction step of BRAKER1 with AUGUSTUS (on softmasked genomes) and MAKER2 (with fully automatic repeat masking, RNA-Seq only source of extrinsic evidence) in genomes of four model organisms." to clarify that this table indeed contains gene prediction results of AUGUSTUS from within BRAKER1. BRAKER1 is a pipeline that uses the advantages of GeneMark-ET to train AUGUSTUS, and final predictions within BRAKER are done by AUGUSTUS.

"The work fails to clearly demonstrate the value of RNA-Seq for improving gene prediction accuracy. Ideally, the authors would provide the accuracy statistics for each of the following (note each of these tools is run by the authors as part of their current work, but results are not in all cases reported as part of this study): 1. SNAP, 2. Augustus without rna-seq hints, 3. GenMark-ET without rna-seq hints, 4. Augustus with rna-seq hints, 5. GeneMark-ET with rna-seq hints, 6. Maker, and 7. Braker1. Such a progression should demonstrate the clear added value of RNA-Seq data to providing hints and improving accuracy as compared to ab initio gene prediction without such hints (as previously published). Also, Maker and Braker, if both providing added value in their respective implementations, should be providing improved accuracy statistics as compared to the individual tools providing the input. Otherwise, one would be better off more simply running one of the input predictors alone with or without rna-seq data."

We have added a Supplementary Table 1.3 that shows ab intio gene prediction results of SNAP, AUGUSTUS and GeneMark-ES in context with MAKER2. This means, SNAP and AUGUSTUS were trained using intermediate MAKER2 results. In context with Table 1 (main manuscript), these results demonstrate a clear gain in accuracy when predictions from all three gene finders are combined and RNA-Seq and repeat masking are added by MAKER2.

We have added a Supplementary Table 1.4 that shows ab initio gene prediction results of AUGUSTUS trained by experts (parameters are distributed via the AUGUSTUS release) and ab initio prediction results of AUGUSTUS trained fully automatically by BRAKER1. In context with Table 1 (main manuscript), these results demonstrate a clear gain in accuracy when RNA-Seq information is added by BRAKER1.

We would like to clarify that there is not "GeneMark-ET with rna-seq hints". GeneMark-ET always performs ab initio predictions. RNA-Seq information is used during training, only. However, in a way, GeneMark-ES may compare to what you wish to see. GeneMark-ES does not use RNA-Seq information during training.

Comments to the Author
"The manuscript describes a pipeline combining two genome annotation tools for a fully automated RNA-Seq based genome annotation. This is a very important task since till now genome annotation is often still performed by few expert groups in the field in a semi-automated manner, and thus
poses a major bottleneck for the analysis of newly sequenced genomes.

The proposed pipeline may not be the be all and end all of RNA-Seq based genome annotation. It would be more desirable to integrate the two concepts in a single statistical framework. However, to make such an integration work robustly and reliably in practice across a range of species is an substantial effort or which other people may benefit. Moreover, the total runtime of 17 CPU hours seems favourable."

Minor:

"Some hints on which parameters of the genome/RNA-Seq data mainly dominate the runtime would be interesting."

MARIO, PLEASE RESOND TO THIS!

"It would have been interesting to understand why GeneMark-ET outperformed Augustus for the yeast dataset. Some comments in the supplement would be sufficient in my opinion, since the overall usefulness of the pipeline is sufficiently supported."

There is a comment on this in Supplementary Materials (in the caption of Supplementary Table 1.1): "On the fungus \textit{S.~pombe}, GeneMark-ET is superior to AUGUSTUS in the current version of BRAKER1. This is likely to be related to special features in intron splicing mechanism in fungal genomes where the branch point site plays a larger role in splicing than in other species. On the other hand, the acceptor site in fungi plays a smaller role in intron recognition mechanism and carries less signal information. GeneMark-ET has special models to accommodate fungal gene organization, therefore, it delivers accuracy that is difficult to exceed even with use of RNA-Seq information in prediction step. However, in future versions of BRAKER1 with AUGUSTUS adapting such a model we expect to see the same pattern of improving accuracy with respect to pure ab initio predictions made by GeneMark-ET."
