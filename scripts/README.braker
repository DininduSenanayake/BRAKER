  1.  INTRODUCTION
  2.  INSTALLATION
  3.  RUNNING BRAKER1
  4.  OUTPUT OF BRAKER1
  5.  EXAMPLE DATA

              1. INTRODUCTION
              ---------------
BRAKER1 is a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. BRAKER1 requires an RNA-Seq read alignment file (in the bam format) and a genome file as input. First,  GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures using support from RNA-Seq. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information as extrinsic evidence into final gene predictions. For more information on AUGUSTUS or GeneMark-ET see their respective README files.

              2. INSTALLATION
              ---------------

At the time of release, this BRAKER1 version, the pipeline was tested with:

   * AUGUSTUS 3.1.0
   * GeneMark-ET 4.29
   * BAMTOOLS 2.3.0
   * SAMTOOLS 1.2 (using htslib 1.2.1)

1. Download GeneMark-ET from http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi

2. Download AUGUSTUS from http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/downloads/index.php

3. Download BAMTOOLS (e.g. e.g. git clone https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools.git)

4. Install BAMTOOLS by typing the following in your shell:

   cd your-bamtools-directory
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

5. Unpack and install GeneMark-ET as described in GeneMark-ET's README file.

6. Unpack and install AUGUSTUS. AUGUSTUS comes with pre-compiled binaries (located in the 
   augustus-x.x.x/bin folder). However, you should compile AUGUSTUS on your own system in order
   to avoid future problems. Compilation instructions are provided in the AUGUSTUS README file
   (augustus-x.x.x/README.txt).
   Make sure, you also compile bam2hints (included in the main AUGUSTUS Makefile; in case
   of problems, you find further instructions on bam2hints compilation in the file
   augustus-x.x.x/auxprogs/bam2hints/README).
   BRAKER1 needs writing access to the AUGUSTUS directory config/. If you install AUGUSTUS
   globally, you need to copy config/ to a location where users have writing permission.

7. Optional: 
      SAMTOOLS is not required for running BRAKER1 if all your files are formatted, correctly
      (i.e. all sequences should have short and unique fasta names). If you are not sure
      whether all your files are fomatted correctly, it might be helpful to have SAMTOOLS
      installed (BRAKER1 will then try to use SAMTOOLS to solve certain issues).

      As a prerequisite for SAMTOOLS, download and install htslib (e.g. 
      git clone https://github.com/samtools/htslib.git, follow the htslib documentation for 
      installation).

      Download and install SAMTOOLS (e.g. git clone git://github.com/samtools/samtools.git), 
      subsequently follow SAMTOOLS documentation for installation). 

8. Install the required PERL modules available on CPAN:
   			     	File::Spec::Functions
				Hash::Merge
				List::Util
				Logger::Simple
				Module::Load::Conditional
				Parallel::ForkManager
				POSIX
				Scalar::Util::Numeric
				YAML 
   (on Ubuntu, install the modules e.g. with CPANminus: "cpanm [Module::Name]")

   BRAKER1 also uses the PERL module helpMod.pm that is not available on CPAN. This module is 
   part of the BRAKER1 relase and does not require separate installation.

9. Add the directories in which braker.pl, AUGUSTUS executables, AUGUSTUS scripts reside to 
   your $PATH environment variable, e.g. for your current bash session:

   PATH=/my_path_to_braker/:/my_path_to_augustus/bin/:/my_path_to_augustus/scripts/:$PATH
   export PATH

   You may want to add these lines to a startup script (like ~/.bashrc).

   Exporting the location of AUGUSTUS and AUGUSTUS scripts is not required 
   by BRAKER1 if you set the environment variables in step 10.

10. Optional: set environment variables $AUGUSTUS_PATH, $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH, $GENEMARK_PATH and 
              $BAMTOOLS_PATH (and $SAMTOOLS_PATH)

    AUGUSTUS by default contains three directories that are of importance to BRAKER1: bin/ config/
    and scripts/. 
      Scenario 1: You are using a local AUGUSTUS installation, i.e. AUGUSTUS resides in your home
                  directory. Then, those three folders are contained in the AUGUSTUS installation
                  folder. You have writing access to the subfolder and subfolders of config/. 
                  You must either specify the command line argument --AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/path
                  /to/augustus/config, or you must export an environment variable 
                  $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH. (Exporting the variable is described further down).
      Scenario 2: You are using a global AUGUSTuS installation, i.e. AUGUSTUS folders bin/ and
                  scripts/ are not located in your home directory. Let's assume, they reside in
                  /usr/local/augustus. You do not have writing access to /usr/local/augustus/config.
                  If this is the case, you must specify two different paths: one to the directory
                  that contains bin/ and scripts/ folder (AUGUSTUS_PATH) and a second path to 
                  a writable AUGUSTUS config directory (AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH). The AUGUSTUS config
                  directory cannot be a random writeable directory. It must be local copy of the 
                  config/ folder that was installed with AUGUSTUS (or you download AUGUSTUS, 
                  separately, unpack, and copy the there contained config/ folder to a location of
                  your choice).
      Scenario 3: There is a global AUGUSTUS installation and a local AUGUSTUS installation. In
                  this case, BRAKER1 will always favour the local installation. Please use the
                  directions given for scenario 1. If you use the directions given in scenario 2,
                  BRAKER1 will nevertheless always check for the local sources, first (i.e. global
                  installation will not be used).
    If the environment variable $AUGUSTUS_PATH is set, it should contain the following folders of
    AUGUSTUS installation: bin/ (containing compiled binaries augustus and etraining) and scripts/
    (containing AUGUSTUS related scripts).

    export AUGUSTUS_PATH=/my_path_to_AUGUSTUS/augustus

    $AUGUSTUS_PATH - if exported, and if bin/ and scripts/ do not exist in $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH../,
                     is used to determine path to AUGUSTUS executables, AUGUSTUS scripts and 
                     bam2hints (global installation).

    The $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH determines which directory is used for reading and writing species 
    configuration files (and in case of local installation, also for finding augustus binaries
    and scripts). During training, AUGUSTUS writes species-specific parameter files to this 
    directory. Therefore, you need write permissions for the directory that is $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH. 
    If the $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH environment variable is not set, then the programs will look in the 
    path ../config relative to the directory in which the AUGUSTUS executable is located. If required,
    export the variable e.g. for your current bash session:

    export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/my_path_to_AUGUSTUS/augustus/config/

    $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH - if exported - is also used by BRAKER1 to determine the relative 
    			    path to the AUGUSTUS executable, AUGUSTUS scripts and bam2hints (local
                            installaton).

    If the environment variable $GENEMARK_PATH is set, BRAKER1 will look there for the gmes_petap.pl 
    script. Export the variable e.g. for your current bash session:

    export GENEMARK_PATH=/my_path_to_GeneMark-ET/gmes_petap/

    If the environment variable $BAMTOOLS_PATH is set, BRAKER1 will look there for the bamtools 
    executable. Export the variable e.g. for your current bash session:

    export BAMTOOLS_PATH=/my_path_to_bamtools/bin/

    If the environment variable $SAMTOOLS_PATH is set, BRAKER1 will look there for the samtools 
    executable. Export the variable e.g. for your current bash session:

    export SAMTOOLS_PATH=/my_path_to_samtools/

    You may want to add these lines to a startup script (like ~/.bashrc). Pay attention, that you 
    do not specify the actual executable when exporting paths, but only the path to where the 
    executable resides.

    Alternatively, you can specify these directories on the command line when running BRAKER1:

    --AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/my_path_to_AUGUSTUS/augustus/config/ 
    --GENEMARK_PATH=/my_path_to_GeneMark-ET/gmes_petap/
    --BAMTOOLS_PATH=/my_path_to_bamtools/bin/
    --SAMTOOLS_PATH=/my/path_to_samtools/

              3. RUNNING BRAKER1
              ------------------

BRAKER1 has two mandatory arguments: a genome file in fasta format and an RNA-Seq alignment file in bam format.

The genome file contains the DNA input sequence and must be in uncompressed (multiple) fasta format, the file may look like this:

>name_of_sequence_1
agtgctgcatgctagctagct
>name_of_sequence_2
gtgctngcatgctagctagctggtgtnntgaaaaatt

Every letter other than a,c,g,t,A,C,G and T is interpreted as an unknown base. Digits and white spaces are ignored. The number of characters per line is not restricted.

The bam file contains unassembled RNA-Seq read alignments. 

Alternatively to the bam file, spliced alignment information may be passed as "intron hints" in gff format using the argument --hints=gff-hintsfilename, the file may look like this:

contig_name	TopHat2	intron	2740	2888	25	+	.	.

Required values in the gff format file for GeneMark-ET (for more details, see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/spec.html):

Column <seqname>     value should match the corresponding definition line in the FASTA file with sequence
Column <source>      in this case TopHat2 (value in this column may be anything)
Column <feature>     value "intron" (obligatory!)
Columns <start><end> intron coordinates, <start> points to first nucleotide of intron and <end> to the last one. 
                     Index starts from "1"
Column <score>       in case of TopHat2, score is the number of reads spanning this intron (reported by TopHat2)
                     in case of UnSplicer or TrueSight, score is the probability like estimate of intron quality,
                     reported by these tools
Column <strand>     + or -
Values in other columns (frame and attribute) are not used in this program version.


IMPORTANT: the names of contigs in <seqname> column in gff must be found as sequence names in the corresponding FASTA file (in the usage example below: genome.fa)!
  
Usage:

perl braker.pl [OPTIONS] --genome=genome.fa --bam=RNAseq.bam
perl braker.pl [OPTIONS] --genome=genome.fa --hints=RNAseq.gff


'genome.fa' is the filename (including relative path) to the file containing the query sequence(s) in fasta format.
'RNAseq.bam' is the filename (including relative path) to the file containing the RNA-seq alingment data in bam format.
'RNAseq.gff' is the filename (including relative path) to the file containing introns extracted from RNA-Seq information in gff format.

Selected parameters:

--alternatives-from-evidence=true/false
  Report alternative transcripts when they are suggested by hints, default is true.

--AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/my_path_to_AUGUSTUS/augustus/config/ 
  Path to AUGUSTUS config directory (if not specified as environment variable). Has higher priority than the
  environment variable.

--AUGUSTUS_PATH=/my_path_to_AUGUSTUS_folders_bin_and_scripts/
  Path to AUGUSTUS directories bin/ and scripts (if not specified as environment variable). If a local installation
  exists (i.e. AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH/../ contains bin/ and scripts/), the local installation will be used, instead!

--cores=n
  Specifies the maximum number of cores that can be used during computation

--fungus
  GeneMark-ET option: to run algorithm with branch point model (most useful for fungal genomes)

--GENEMARK_PATH=/my_path_to_GeneMark-ET/gmes_petap/
  Path to GeneMark-ET (if not specified as environment variable). Has higher priority than environment
  variable.

--BAMTOOLS_PATH=/path/to/bamtools/
  Path to bamtools (if not specified as environment variable). Has higher priority than the
  environment variable.

--SAMTOOLS_PATH=/path/to/samtools/
  Optional: set path to samtools (if not specified as environment variable). In some cases, users of BRAKER1 reported that they "shortend" the headers of FASTA files after their first attempt to run BRAKER1, but they forgot to fix the same sequence names in the BAM file. SAMTOOLS is used by BRAKER1 to automatically fix such issues. The command line flag has higher priority than environment variable.

--hints=hints.gff            
  Additional hints files for gene predictions with AUGUSTUS in gff format (should only be used in combination
  with --optCfgFile)

--optCfgFile=extrinsic.cfg
  Optional config file for AUGUSTUS, should be used if --hints is used, and if you desire to use extrinsic 
  configuration parameters deviating from the BRAKER1 default values.

--overwrite
  Overwrite existing files

--skipGeneMark-ET
  Skip GeneMark-ET and use provided GeneMark-ET output (e.g. from a different source)
 
--skipOptimize
  Skip optimize parameter step (not recommended!)

--softmasking

--useexisting
  Use the present config and parameter files if they exist for 'speciesname'

--UTR=on/off
  Predict the untranslated regions in addition to the coding sequence. This currently works only for the species
  human, galdieria, toxoplasma and caenorhabditis.

--workingdir=/path/to/wd/
  Path to working directory in which results and temporary files are stored (default: current directory).

--species=speciesname
  speciesname is a directory in ${AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH}/species, which is used to read AUGUSTUS species
  parameters from, and write such parameter so. Usually, BRAKER1 is used to train AUGUSTUS for new species, i.e.
  the speciesname should be a species name that does not already exist in ${AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH}/species.
  Existing species files will not be overwritten. If the argument --species is not used, BRAKER1 generates
  speciesnames of the type Sp_1 etc. For example you may type

--version
  Print version number of braker.pl

  perl braker --species=new_species  --genome=../examples/example.fa  --bam=../examples/example.bam

  to create a new species 'new_species'.

  Alternatively to training AUGUSTUS, it is possible run AUGUSTUS with already existing parameters. In that case,
  speciesname can be any of the species names contained in ${AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH}/species. In the following,
  you find a list of species identifiers that may be used as speciesname (for use with --useexisting) and that
  are part of the current AUGUSTUS release:

              --------------------

BRAKER1 produces three important output files in the working directory:

introns.gff   - The introns extraced from RNAseq.bam. These introns are used for training GeneMark-ET and
                for predicting genes with AUGUSTUS. The file is in gff format (see section 3, input argument 
                --hints).
genemark.gtf  - Genes predicted by GeneMark-ET in gtf format
augustus.gff  - Genes predicted by AUGUSTUS in gtf format

For details about gtf format, see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/. A gtf format file contains one line per predicted exon. Example:

HS04636   AUGUSTUS   initial    966     1017    .       +       0       transcript_id "g1.1"; gene_id "g1";
HS04636   AUGUSTUS   internal   1818    1934    .       +       2       transcript_id "g1.1"; gene_id "g1";

The columns (fields) contain: 
seqname   source     feature    start   end   score   strand   frame    transcript ID and gene ID


              5. EXAMPLE DATA
              ---------------

Due to file size, example data for testing BRAKER1 is separately available for download at http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/downloads/index.php and http://exon.gatech.edu/ as archive BRAKER1examples.tar.gz.

After extraction, test BRAKER1 with the following command:

perl braker.pl --genome=/path/to/examples/genome.fa --bam=/path/to/examples/RNAseq.bam

The runtime of this example should be around 46 hours on a 2.27 GHz single CPU.
